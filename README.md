```

### Dependencies

- SQLite3

## Usage

### CLI mode

The CLI interface is designed for developer usage, allowing to quickly generate traffic for 5GTANGO project. The possibilities offered by this tool are displayed below:

- service is used to launch the API REST
- traffic-object is used to operate with the traffic generation objects. It allows creation, listing, detailed view and removal
- flow is used to operate with the traffic flows. It allows creation, status retrieval, removal and start/stop the traffic flows

```
> tng-sdk-traffic
Please, select one of the offered commands to continue.

usage: tng-sdk-traffic [-h] [--verbose] {service,traffic-object,flow} ...

positional arguments:
  {service,traffic-object,flow}
                        Commands offered by the traffic generation tool
    service             Launch tng-sdk-traffic in service mode
    traffic-object      Traffic generation object commands
    flow                Traffic flow commands

| Retrieve a list of traffic generation objects              | `GET`    | `/trafficObject`                 | Gives a list of the created traffic generation objects.                                    |
| Retrieve a traffic generation object                       | `GET`    | `/trafficObject/{resource_uuid}` | Gives the configuration and status of an existing traffic generation object.               |
| Removes traffic generation object                          | `DELETE` | `/trafficObject/{resource_uuid}` | Removes and stops (if active) traffic generation object.                                   |
| Creates a traffic flow in existing object                  | `POST`   | `/flows/{flow_uuid}`             | Creates a specific traffic flow. Not configuration required.                               |

    `tng-sdk-traffic --service --address 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`

2.  List the traffic objects created:

    `tng-sdk-traffic traffic-object --list`

3.  Add a traffic object to the DB:

    `tng-sdk-traffic traffic-object --add '{"name": "object1", "protocol": "UDP"}'`

4.  View details of a traffic object:

    `tng-sdk-traffic traffic-object --detail 805e130b-3e54-11e8-819f-a0c5897a10ac`

5.  Remove a traffic object:

    `tng-sdk-traffic traffic-object --remove 805e130b-3e54-11e8-819f-a0c5897a10ac`
